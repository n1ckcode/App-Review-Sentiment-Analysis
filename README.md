# App-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I analyzed an app review dataset from Kaggle and conducted sentiment analysis to gain insights into user feedback. The dataset contained reviews from users who had downloaded and used various mobile apps. To begin, I preprocessed the data by cleaning and transforming the text data to make it suitable for analysis. Next, I performed sentiment analysis using a python and SQL to classify the reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. 

Based on the analysis of the sample dataset, I discovered that a high rating doesn't always indicate a positive sentiment from users. Some users can give high ratings but still have neutral sentiments towards the app. This highlights the importance of looking beyond ratings and considering the specific wording of user reviews.
